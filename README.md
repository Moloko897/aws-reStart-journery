# My Restart Graduate Journey

As a student of the AWS re/Start program, I’ve built a solid foundation in cloud computing, focusing on core AWS services, security, networking, and database fundamentals. Through hands-on labs and real-world scenarios, I developed practical skills in configuring EC2 instances, automating tasks with scripts, and troubleshooting cloud infrastructure issues. This journey has not only deepened my technical expertise but also sparked a passion for building secure, scalable, and innovative cloud solutions. I'm now eager to apply these skills in a dynamic IT environment and continue growing as a cloud professional.
