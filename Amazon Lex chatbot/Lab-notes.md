# Amazon Lex Chatbot
# Objective

The goal was to design a quiz chatbot in Amazon Lex for CloudLearners Inc. that:

-Tests learners’ knowledge of Amazon S3.

-Provides immediate feedback (correct/incorrect).

-Uses branching logic to guide the conversation.

-Creates an engaging and interactive learning experience.

# Steps Taken

Intent Creation - Built an intent called S3Quiz with utterances such as “Start quiz”, “Quiz me on S3”.

Question Setup - Added the first multiple-choice question with answer slots (A/B/C).

Branching Logic - Configured slot capture success to provide different responses for correct vs incorrect answers.

Additional Questions - Linked follow-up quiz questions with conditional branching.

Feedback & Flow - Ensured the bot gives feedback before moving to the next question.

Testing  - Build and Tested the bot in Lex console.

# Challenges

Slot Handling – Ensuring answer slots (A/B/C) captured user responses correctly instead of defaulting to Yes/No.

Branching Logic – Configuring conditional responses so the chatbot didn’t skip straight to the next question.

# Solution
-Checked Sample Utterances
-I used “Generate utterances,” but did not have Bedrock permissions, so i then deleted those and Added valid sample utterance for the intent  manually.
-Saved  then Build the intent
