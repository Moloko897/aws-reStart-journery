# What is Amazon Lex Chatbot

An Amazon Lex chatbot is a conversational interface you build using Amazon Lex, an AWS service that enables applications to understand voice and text input.
An Amazon Lex chatbot is an AI-powered bot that can interact with users naturally, guide conversations, and perform tasks such as answering questions, running quizzes, booking services, or providing support without needing complex coding.

## Key Components of Lex

Intents - The purpose of the user’s input (e.g., Book a flight, Start quiz).

Utterances - Example phrases users might say to trigger an intent (e.g., “I want to start a quiz”).

Slots - Variables to capture specific information from the user (e.g., destination, quiz answer).

Prompts - Messages to guide the user when more details are needed.

Fulfillment - The action taken once all required information is collected (e.g., call a Lambda function, return a response).

Bot Alias - A deployable version of the bot for testing or production.

### Key Takeaways

Amazon Lex provides a no-code/low-code way to build intelligent chatbots.

The workflow is intent-driven: Utterances → Intent recognition → Slot collection → Fulfillment.

Bots created in Lex can be integrated into websites, mobile apps, or even messaging platforms.

It supports branching logic for quizzes, customer service flows, and more.

# Reflection

Through this project, I learned how to design and configure a chatbot in AWS Lex from scratch. I gained hands-on experience with intents, utterances, and slots, and saw how Lex manages conversation flow. The most valuable skill was learning how to handle user interaction with branching logic, which is essential for quizzes or decision-based conversations.

Overall, this experience improved both my technical knowledge of AWS services and my ability to explain and present solutions, preparing me to create more advanced chatbots in real-world scenarios.
