# What is IAM?

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a cybersecurity framework that enables organizations to securely manage digital identities
and control user access to systems, applications, and data based on defined roles and policies.

 What IAM Does

At its core, IAM answers two big questions:
- Who are you? (Identity)
- What are you allowed to do? (Access)


## Key Components of IAM

- Users & Groups: Represent people or services that need access.

- Roles & Policies: Define what actions are allowed.

- Authentication: Verifies identity (e.g., passwords, MFA).

- Authorization: Grants access based on permissions.

- Audit & Monitoring: Tracks who did what, when, and how.

### Key Takeaways

- Learned how IAM enforces least-privilege access across AWS resources
- Created and applied custom policies to regulate EC2.

#### Reflection

Learning about IAM has deepened my understanding of how secure access is structured in cloud environments.
