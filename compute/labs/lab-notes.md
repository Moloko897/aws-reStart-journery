# Compute Lab: Introduction to Amazon EC2

## Objective
Learn how to do basic overview of launching, resizing, managing,Terminating an instance and monitoring an Amazon EC2 instance.

## Steps Taken
Launch a web server with termination protection enabled

Monitor my EC2 instance

Resize my Amazon EC2 instance to scale

Test termination protection

Terminate my EC2 instance

## Challenges
- Forgot to open port 22 in the security group
- Solved by editing the inbound rules

 Monitoring
 instance status monitoring, I can quickly determine whether Amazon EC2 has detected any problems that might prevent my instances from running applications. Amazon EC2 performs automated checks on every running EC2 instance to identify hardware and software issues.
